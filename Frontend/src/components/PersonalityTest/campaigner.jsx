              While they are great at generating new ideas, they sometimes put
              off important tasks until the last minute. Dreaming up ideas but
              not seeing them through to completion is a common problem.

        <span>Cognitive Functions</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          Each personality type is composed of four cognitive functions that
          relate to how people process information and make decisions. It is the
          first two functions that play the most obvious role in personality.
          The latter two functions also play a role in personality, although
          their influence may only arise in certain settings or situations.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2 className="h22">
        <span>Dominant: Extraverted Intuition</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          ENFPs generally focus on the world of possibilities. They are good at
          abstract thinking and prefer not to concentrate on tiny details.
        </span>
        <span>
          <span>4</span>
        </span>
        <span>
          They are inventive and focused on the future. ENFPs are good at seeing
          things as they might be rather than focusing simply on what they are.
          They have a natural tendency to focus on relationships and are skilled
          at finding patterns and connections between people, situations, and
          ideas.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2 className="h22">
        <span>Auxiliary: Introverted Feeling</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          When making decisions, ENFPs place a greater value on feelings and
          values rather than on logic and objective criteria. They tend to
          follow their heart, empathize with others, and let their emotions
          guide their decisions. ENFPs have a strong desire to be true to
          themselves and their values. In an ideal world, their world would be
          in congruence with their values.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2 className="h22">
        <span>Tertiary: Extraverted Thinking</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          This cognitive function is centered on logically organizing
          information and ideas. When looking at information, the ENFP may use
          this function to sort through disparate data to efficiently spot
          connections. For example, an ENFP might "think out loud" as they are
          working through a problem, laying out all the information to create an
          easily followed train of thought.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2 className="h22">
        <span>Inferior: Introverted Sensing</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          ENFPs express this function by comparing the things they are
          experiencing at the moment to past experiences. In doing so, they are
          often able to call to mind memories, feelings, and senses that they
          associate with those events. This allows the individual to seek
          patterns and form expectations for future events based upon their
          previous experiences.

          Socializing actually gives them more energy, helping them to feel
          renewed, refreshed, and excited about life. While other types of
          extraverts tend to dislike solitude, ENFPs do have a need for some
          alone time in order to think and reflect.

        <span>
          ENFPs tend to be warm and passionate in relationships. As extraverts,
          they are naturally upbeat and gregarious. In relationships, they are
          always seeking growth and ways to make their partnerships stronger.
          They tend to be attentive and spontaneous. Their willingness to take
          risks can sometimes be stressful for those who love them.

          When choosing a career path, it is a good idea for people to
          understand the potential strengths and weaknesses of their personality

          a lot of flexibility.
