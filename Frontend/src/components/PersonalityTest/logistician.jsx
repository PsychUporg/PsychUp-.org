          (MBTI). People with an ISTJ personality type tend to be reserved,
          practical and quiet. They enjoy order and organization in all areas of
          their lives including their home, work, family, and projects. ISTJs
          value loyalty in themselves and others, and place an emphasis on
          traditions.

              ISTJs are planners; they like to carefully plan things out well in
              advance. They enjoy an orderly life. They like things to be
              well-organized and pay a great deal of attention to detail. When
              things are in disarray, people with this personality type may find
              themselves unable to rest until they have set everything straight
              and the work has been completed.

              ISTJs are both responsible and realistic. They take a logical
              approach to achieving goals and completing projects and are able
              to work at a steady pace toward accomplishing these tasks. They
              are able to ignore distractions in order to focus on the task at
              hand and are often described as dependable and trustworthy.

              ISTJs also place a great deal of emphasis on traditions and laws.
              They prefer to follow rules and procedures that have previously
              been established. In some cases, ISTJs can seem rigid and
              unyielding in their desire to maintain structure.

          The MBTI suggests that the four different cognitive functions
          (thinking, feeling, intuition, and sensing) form a hierarchy. Each
          function is either directed outwardly (extraverted) or inwardly
          (introverted) and the order of these functions determines an
          individual's personality.

            <span>
              As they make judgments, ISTJs often make personal interpretations
              based on their internal set of values.

              This is often described as an "instinct" or "gut feeling" about a
              situation. ISTJ might make a decision based on logic, only to have
              this feeling kick in telling them to trust their feelings rather
              than just the facts.

        <span>
          ISTJs prefer spending time alone or with small groups of close
          friends. People with this personality type are usually very loyal and
          devoted to family and friends but may struggle to understand their own
          emotions and the feelings of others. They can be quite reserved and
          sometimes fail to pick up on the emotional signals given by other
          people. However, once they are close to a person and develop an
          understanding of that person's feelings and needs, they will expend a
          great deal of effort toward supporting those needs.

          Because of this need for order, they tend to do better in learning and
          work environments that have clearly defined schedules, clear-cut
          assignments, and a strong focus on the task at hand. When learning new
          things, ISTJs do best when the material is something they view as
          useful with real-world applications. Concrete, factual information
          appeals to ISTJs, while theoretical and abstract information has
          little value unless they can see some type of practical use for it.
          While they may exert tremendous energy into projects they see as
          valuable, they will avoid wasting time and energy on things that they
          view as useless or unpractical.

          ISTJs tend to do well in careers that require order, structure, and
          perseverance. Jobs that involve dealing with concrete facts and
          figures (accounting, library science, computer programming, etc.) are
          all good options. Jobs that require accuracy, respect for rules and
          stability often appeal to those with an ISTJ personality.
