          Because of their ability to sense what others feel and affect how
          people behave, they do have the ability to influence and even
          manipulate others. This is balanced by their strong value system and
          desire to help other people be the best that they can be. ENFJ is the

              ENFJs have great people skills and are often described as warm,
              affectionate, and supportive.

              ENFJs are great at encouraging other people and derive personal
              satisfaction from helping others.

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span>
              ENFJs are often so interested in devoting their time to others
              that they can neglect their own needs.
            </span>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span>
              ENFJs also have a tendency to be too hard on themselves, blaming
              themselves for when things go wrong and not giving themselves
              enough credit when things go right. Because of this, it is
              important that people with this personality type regularly set
              aside some time to attend to their own needs.
            </span>
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            <span>
              ENFJs are good at bringing consensus among diverse people. For
              this reason, they can be outstanding leaders and bring enthusiasm
              to a group that can be motivating and inspirational.

          One common myth about the protagonist personality is that they are
          always sociable. While they love people, they do need time alone in
          order to assimilate and organize their thoughts.

      <h2>
        <span>Cognitive Functions</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          Each Myers-Briggs personality type can be identified by a hierarchical
          stack of cognitive functions that represent how each person interacts
          with the world. These functions focus on how people take in
          information about the world and how they then use this information to
          make decisions.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h2>
        <span>Dominant: Extraverted Feeling</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          ENFJs express this cognitive function through their engaging social
          behavior and harmonious social relationships. They are in tune with
          other people's feelings, often to the point that they ignore their own
          needs in order to please others.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          People with a protagonist personality place a stronger emphasis on
          personal, subjective considerations rather than objective criteria
          when making decisions. How a decision will impact others is often a
          primary concern.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h2>
        <span>Auxiliary: Introverted Intuition</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          ENFJs like to think about the future rather than the present. They may
          often become so focused on the larger goal that they lose sight of the
          immediate details.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          As ENFJs take in information about the world, their introverted
          intuition processes this data in order to create impressions, ideas,
          and thoughts. This allows them to spot patterns and make sense of
          complex or abstract data.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>
        <span>Tertiary: Extraverted Sensing</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          Extraverted sensing causes ENFJs to take in the present moment,
          gathering concrete details and sensory information from the
          environment. Because of this, they will often seek out novel or
          interesting experiences and sensations.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          People with the protagonist personality type tend to be very aware of
          their present environment. This can lead to a great appreciation of
          aesthetics and a desire to create a pleasing space.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>
        <span>Inferior: Introverted Thinking</span>
      </h2>
      <p className="p1">
        <span>
          ENFJs are organized and enjoy structure and careful planning. Sticking
          to a predictable schedule helps ENFJs feel in control of the world
          around them.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Because this is an inferior function, ENFPs may not have a great deal
          of confidence in their own ability to be logical and organized.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Developing this function can help people with this personality type
          feel more balanced and in control of their decision-making process.
          Neglecting this aspect of personality can lead to relying solely on
          personal values when making decisions.

          As parents, ENFJs are nurturing and warm, although they can sometimes
          be accused of being so-called "helicopter parents." They are directly
          involved in their children's lives, although they can sometimes be
          quite strict and even rigid at times.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          ENFJs need to remember to give their children room to explore and
