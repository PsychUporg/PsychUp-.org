        >ENFPs have excellent people skills. In addition to having an abundance
        of enthusiasm, they also genuinely care about others. ENFPs are good at
        understanding what other people are feeling. Given their zeal, charisma,

        While they are great at generating new ideas, they sometimes put off
        important tasks until the last minute. Dreaming up ideas but not seeing
        them through to completion is a common problem.</span

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Cognitive Functions</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Each personality type is composed of four cognitive functions that relate
    to how people process information and make decisions. It is the first two
    functions that play the most obvious role in personality. The latter two
    functions also play a role in personality, although their influence may only
    arise in certain settings or situations.</span
  >
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Dominant: Extraverted Intuition</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >ENFPs generally focus on the world of possibilities. They are good at
    abstract thinking and prefer not to concentrate on tiny details.</span
  ><span><span>4</span></span
  ><span>
    They are inventive and focused on the future. ENFPs are good at seeing
    things as they might be rather than focusing simply on what they are. They
    have a natural tendency to focus on relationships and are skilled at finding
    patterns and connections between people, situations, and ideas.</span
  >
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Auxiliary: Introverted Feeling</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >When making decisions, ENFPs place a greater value on feelings and values
    rather than on logic and objective criteria. They tend to follow their
    heart, empathize with others, and let their emotions guide their decisions.
    ENFPs have a strong desire to be true to themselves and their values. In an
    ideal world, their world would be in congruence with their values.</span
  >
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Tertiary: Extraverted Thinking</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >This cognitive function is centered on logically organizing information and
    ideas. When looking at information, the ENFP may use this function to sort
    through disparate data to efficiently spot connections. For example, an ENFP
    might "think out loud" as they are working through a problem, laying out all
    the information to create an easily followed train of thought.</span
  >
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Inferior: Introverted Sensing</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >ENFPs express this function by comparing the things they are experiencing
    at the moment to past experiences. In doing so, they are often able to call
    to mind memories, feelings, and senses that they associate with those
    events. This allows the individual to seek patterns and form expectations
    for future events based upon their previous experiences.</span

  ><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-extroversion-2795994"

  ><span><span>5</span></span
  ><span>
    Socializing actually gives them more energy, helping them to feel renewed,
    refreshed, and excited about life. While other types of extraverts tend to
    dislike solitude, ENFPs do have a need for some alone time in order to think
    and reflect.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >ENFPs tend to be warm and passionate in relationships. As extraverts, they
    are naturally upbeat and gregarious. In relationships, they are always
    seeking growth and ways to make their partnerships stronger. They tend to be
    attentive and spontaneous. Their willingness to take risks can sometimes be
    stressful for those who love them.</span

    >When choosing a career path, it is a good idea for people to understand the
    potential strengths and weaknesses of their personality type. People with
    the ENFP personality type do best in jobs that offer a lot of
    flexibility.</span
  ><span><span>4</span></span>
</p>

    >Because they are empathetic and interested in people, they often do well in
    service-oriented careers. They should avoid careers that involve completing
