    </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">
      <span

        satisfaction from helping others.</span
      >
    </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">
      <span
        >ENFJs are often so interested in devoting their time to others that

    </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">
      <span
        >ENFJs also have a tendency to be too hard on themselves, blaming
        themselves for when things go wrong and not giving themselves enough
        credit when things go right. Because of this, it is important that
        people with this personality type regularly set aside some time to
        attend to their own needs.</span

  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">
      <span

  <span
    >One common myth about the protagonist personality is that they are always

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Cognitive Functions</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Each Myers-Briggs personality type can be identified by a hierarchical
    stack of cognitive functions that represent how each person interacts with
    the world. These functions focus on how people take in information about the
    world and how they then use this information to make decisions.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">
  <span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Dominant: Extraverted Feeling</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >ENFJs express this cognitive function through their engaging social
    behavior and harmonious social relationships. They are in tune with other
    people's feelings, often to the point that they ignore their own needs in
    order to please others.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">
  <span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >People with a protagonist personality place a stronger emphasis on
    personal, subjective considerations rather than objective criteria when
    making decisions. How a decision will impact others is often a primary
    concern.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">
  <span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Auxiliary: Introverted Intuition</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >ENFJs like to think about the future rather than the present. They may
    often become so focused on the larger goal that they lose sight of the
    immediate details.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >As ENFJs take in information about the world, their introverted intuition
    processes this data in order to create impressions, ideas, and thoughts.
    This allows them to spot patterns and make sense of complex or abstract
    data.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Tertiary: Extraverted Sensing</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Extraverted sensing causes ENFJs to take in the present moment, gathering
    concrete details and sensory information from the environment. Because of
    this, they will often seek out novel or interesting experiences and
    sensations.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >People with the protagonist personality type tend to be very aware of their
    present environment. This can lead to a great appreciation of aesthetics and
    a desire to create a pleasing space.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Inferior: Introverted Thinking</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >ENFJs are organized and enjoy structure and careful planning. Sticking to a
    predictable schedule helps ENFJs feel in control of the world around
    them.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Because this is an inferior function, ENFPs may not have a great deal of
    confidence in their own ability to be logical and organized.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Developing this function can help people with this personality type feel
    more balanced and in control of their decision-making process. Neglecting
    this aspect of personality can lead to relying solely on personal values
    when making decisions.</span
