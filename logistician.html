    (MBTI). People with an ISTJ personality type tend to be reserved, practical
    and quiet. They enjoy order and organization in all areas of their lives
    including their home, work, family, and projects. ISTJs value loyalty in
    themselves and others, and place an emphasis on traditions.</span

    <p dir="ltr">
      <span
        >ISTJs are planners; they like to carefully plan things out well in
        advance. They enjoy an orderly life. They like things to be
        well-organized and pay a great deal of attention to detail. When things
        are in disarray, people with this personality type may find themselves
        unable to rest until they have set everything straight and the work has
        been completed.</span

    <p dir="ltr">
      <span
        >ISTJs are both responsible and realistic. They take a logical approach
        to achieving goals and completing projects and are able to work at a
        steady pace toward accomplishing these tasks. They are able to ignore
        distractions in order to focus on the task at hand and are often
        described as dependable and trustworthy.</span

    <p dir="ltr">
      <span
        >ISTJs also place a great deal of emphasis on traditions and laws. They
        prefer to follow rules and procedures that have previously been
        established. In some cases, ISTJs can seem rigid and unyielding in their
        desire to maintain structure.</span

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Cognitive Functions</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >The MBTI suggests that the four different cognitive functions (thinking,
    feeling, intuition, and sensing) form a hierarchy. Each function is either
    directed outwardly (extraverted) or inwardly (introverted) and the order of
    these functions determines an individual's personality.</span

  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">
      <span

      <span

  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">
      <span
        >This is often described as an "instinct" or "gut feeling" about a
        situation. ISTJ might make a decision based on logic, only to have this
        feeling kick in telling them to trust their feelings rather than just
        the facts.</span

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Personal Relationships</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >ISTJs prefer spending time alone or with small groups of close friends.
    People with this personality type are usually very loyal and devoted to
    family and friends but may struggle to understand their own emotions and the
    feelings of others. They can be quite reserved and sometimes fail to pick up
    on the emotional signals given by other people. However, once they are close
    to a person and develop an understanding of that person's feelings and
    needs, they will expend a great deal of effort toward supporting those
    needs.</span

</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Career Paths</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Because of this need for order, they tend to do better in learning and work
    environments that have clearly defined schedules, clear-cut assignments, and
    a strong focus on the task at hand. When learning new things, ISTJs do best
    when the material is something they view as useful with real-world
    applications. Concrete, factual information appeals to ISTJs, while
    theoretical and abstract information has little value unless they can see
    some type of practical use for it. While they may exert tremendous energy
    into projects they see as valuable, they will avoid wasting time and energy
    on things that they view as useless or unpractical.</span

</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >ISTJs tend to do well in careers that require order, structure, and
    perseverance. Jobs that involve dealing with concrete facts and figures
    (accounting, library science, computer programming, etc.) are all good
    options. Jobs that require accuracy, respect for rules and stability often
    appeal to those with an ISTJ personality.</span
