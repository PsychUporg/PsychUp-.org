    People who score as INTP are often described as quiet and analytical. They
    enjoy spending time alone, thinking about how things work, and coming up
    with solutions to problems. INTPs have a rich inner world and would rather
    focus their attention on their internal thoughts rather than the external
    world. They typically do not have a wide social circle, but they do tend to
    be close to a select group of people.&nbsp;</span

      <span

        common interests and connections.</span

      <span
        >They enjoy thinking about theoretical concepts and tend to value
        intellect over emotion. INTPs are logical and base decisions on
        objective information rather than subjective feelings.</span

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Cognitive Functions</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >The MBTI is based upon psychoanalyst Carl Jung's theory which suggests that
    personality is made up of different cognitive functions. The hierarchical
    order of these functions is what establishes personality and behavioral
    patterns. The dominant function is the one that plays the largest role in
    personality, although it is also supported by the auxiliary. The tertiary
    function is less developed, but still exerts some influence and becomes more
    pronounced as a person strengthens this area. The inferior function is
    largely unconscious but represents an area of weakness.</span
  >
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Dominant: Introverted Thinking</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >This function focuses on how people take in information about the world.
    INTPs express this by trying to understand how things work. They often like
    to break down larger things or ideas to look at the individual components to
    see how things fit and function together. INTPs tend to be highly logical
    and efficient thinkers. They like to have a complete understanding of
    something before they are willing to share an opinion or take action.</span
  >
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Auxiliary: Extraverted Intuition</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >INTPs express this cognitive function by exploring what-ifs and
    possibilities. They utilize insight, imagination, and past experiences to
    form ideas. They often go over what they know, seeking patterns until they
    can achieve a flash of inspiration or insight into the problem. They tend to
    spend a great deal of time thinking about the future and imagining all the
    possibilities.</span
  >
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Tertiary: Introverted Sensing</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >INTPs tend to be very detail-oriented, carefully categorizing all of the
    many facts and experiences that they take in. As they collect new
    information, they compare and contrast it with what they already know in
    order to make predictions about what they believe will happen next.</span
  >
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Inferior: Extraverted Feeling</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >INTPs tend to seek harmony in groups. While they are introverted, INTPs can
    be quite outgoing when they are around people with whom they are familiar
    and comfortable. In situations where they feel stress, however, INTPs shut
    down their feelings and struggle to connect with others. Under stress, they
    tend to rely on logic rather than feelings.</span

</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Personal Relationships</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >As introverts, INTPs prefer spending time alone for the most part. Unlike </span
  ><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-extroversion-2795994"
    ><span>extraverts</span></a
  ><span
    >, who gain energy from interacting with a wide group of people, introverts
    must expend energy in social situations.</span
  ><span><span>2</span></span
  ><span>
    After being around a lot of people, INTPs might feel like they need to spend
    some time alone to recharge and find balance. While they may be shy around
    people they do not know well, INTPs tend to be warm and friendly with their
    close group of family and friends.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Because INTPs enjoy solitude and deep thinking, they sometimes strike
    others as aloof and detached. At times, people with this personality type
    can get lost in their own thoughts and lose track of the outside world. They
    love ideas and place a high value on intelligence and knowledge.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >In social situations, INTPs tend to be quite easy-going and tolerant.
    However, they can become unyielding when their beliefs or convictions are
    challenged. Their high emphasis on logic can make it difficult to not
    correct others in situations where other people present arguments that are
    not rational or logical. Because they rely on their own minds rather than
    others, they can also be very difficult to persuade.</span
  >
</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Career Paths</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Because they enjoy theoretical and abstract concepts, INTPs often do
    particularly well in science-related careers. They are logical and have
    strong reasoning skills, but are also excellent at thinking
    creatively.</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >INTPs can be very independent and place a great deal of emphasis on
    personal freedom and autonomy. In some cases, they can be aggravated by
    authority figures, particularly those that they feel are trying to suppress
    their ability to think and act for themselves. Because of this, INTPs
    typically do best in careers as they have a great deal of flexibility and
    independence.</span
